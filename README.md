# India-AQI-monitoring-Dashboard
Project Overview:-
This dashboard visualises real-time air quality levels across different cities in India. The main goal is to identify areas with unhealthy and hazardous air conditions and to understand which pollutants are contributing the most to poor air quality.

About the Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the Government of India’s open data portal.
It contains readings from various pollution monitoring stations across India and includesCity and station locationAQI valuesPollutant type detectedPollution category (Good / Moderate / Unhealthy / Hazardous)Latitude & longitude for mapping

Analytics Process:-
Imported and cleaned data using Power Query in Power BI
Created DAX measures to classify pollution levels and count high-risk areas
Designed KPIs to display total monitored cities and number of impacted locations
Built bar chart, donut chart, and an interactive map for location insights
Highlighted cities with poor air conditions and pollutants with major impact

Key Insights
Several cities show unhealthy or hazardous pollution levels
CO and SO₂ appear frequently in high-pollution zones
Pollution severity is noticeably higher in northern India and major metro areas
Different stations within the same state can show large variations in AQI values

Conclusion

India continues to face serious air-quality related challenges especially in heavily populated regions. Unhealthy Values of CO,SO2 and other PM pollutants will continue to increase rapidly especially in Metro Cities.
